This can be used to write the proposal if we desire. 
Else we can use a word document and include it in the git repository

20 Questions for the client:

1. How would you like the automated email set-up?
   - What account/where would you like the email to be from?
   
2. What would be in the email? (is their a template you’d like us to follow?)

3. How would you like to manage locations?
  - Do you want specific views for each or simply a note/something that says what location?

4. What information would you like users to be able to edit? (are their certain restrictions?)

5. What are the default group time limits for items? (maybe a list of all of them)

6. Is adding a user manually something that should be implemented, or is it only supposed to access members of an already established database?

7. Do you want all information about each item displayed, or only the item number and if it's available?

8. What options other than check out/in do you want? I know there's an option to display whether the customer is banned from checking out equipment; should there be other statuses based on the customer, such as not letting them check out only certain items?

9. Should there be a tab to display all the customers that have an item checked out for an extended period of time?/Customers that are on a "late list"?

10. What exactly should be contained in the email to SAS IT about an item’s broken condition?

11. Are there items that belong specifically to Memorial Union or the Student Center and can all items be checked out and returned at   different places?

12. Is there a limit to how many times an item can be renewed?

13. Should there be some sort of history kept for each item as to who has checked it out and when?

14. Do you want to be able to check an item out at one location and return it to another?

15. How do you want the renewal button to be accessed? 
    - Could a student renew their own laptop, or can only an employee renew a rental?
    
16. When adding/removing desk locations or items, how do you want that organized?  

17. Do you want adding/removing to be only admin access, or any employee can add/remove an item?
    
18. Where do you want overdue notifications to show up?
    - Do you want the pop up to show on the checkin/out computer, or on the student checked out laptop?
    
19. What kind of tags are going to be attached to the items? 

20. Should there be a homepage / dashboard showing the status of all checked out items?
